Debian has a problem detecting the drive
consider validating Search seedlists to help you identify the source of the problem
configure settings caused by long response times from the Search application
PC settings and a reinitialization to the factory default state of the device
When the local area connection Properties window appears,scroll to the bottom of the list
a very short recording will capture and display enough information
One of the most common fixes to a problem is to try to restart your device
use the hibernate feature offer instead of powering off your machine
